Garden Sketch
==============

The Garden Sketch project includes and modifies some aspects of Inkpad to create a foundation for drawing with a controlled set of vector shapes, rather than a full-fledged vector editing application (see 'Modified-InkPad-Files.txt'). 

You are free to use Garden Sketch code, but all artwork is copyright and no rights of use are given in any commercial product.

Garden Sketch requires iOS 7.1 or higher.
